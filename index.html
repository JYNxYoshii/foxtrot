<!----SECTION 1-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
			<h3 class='sct1-hdr'>Who We Are</h3>
			<p class='sct1-desc'>With a small team of about three to four consistent members, we are committed to preserving Code Lyoko in the best quality possible using kick-ass deep-learning algorithms and cold hard sweat to bring you the finest premium USDA-approved viewing experience for Code Lyoko you’ve ever laid eyes on, with all the fixings—subtitles, multiple audio tracks, and bonus features, just like a shiny new DVD or Blu-ray Disc.<br><br>

			This project was originally created by Christian Devile (Christian77777) to improve his home server collection of Code Lyoko. This, however, started to turn into a group effort when he asked for help from Alex who had access to higher-end hardware that would quicken the process of improving his video quality. Christian realized other fans of the show would probably enjoy his efforts, so he made a call for help to the Code Lyoko subreddit to provide him with media required to create a meaningful remaster of the show. A humble but determined group of subtitlers and programmers formed, and we decided to name ourselves the Foxtrot Fanatics—a reference to season one, episode two.</p>
			
<!----SECTION 2-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
			<h3 class='sct2-hdr'>What Are We Doing?<br><small>Our project is actually a subset of two projects that are undergoing development simultaneously.</small></h3>
			<div class='container'>
				<div class='row'>
					<div class='col-sm-3'>
						<p class='listsct-hdr'>Transcription Project</p>
							<div class='list-sct'>
								<ul class='list'>
									<li>Transcription of the entire series, since YouTube's generated captions are stupid most of the time</li><br>
									<li>Synchronizing the transcriptions with the episodes themselves (subtitles, yay!)</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
					</div>
						
					<div class='col-sm-3'>
						<p class='listsct-hdr'>Upscale Project</p>
							<div class='list-sct'>
								<ul class='list'>
									<li>Locating the best original video source of the show</li><br>
									<li>Creating a custom automated program: FoxTrotUpscaler™ (trademark pending)</li><br>
									<li>Facilitating the upscaling via FTU from PAL 576i 25fps to 1440p 25fps</li><br>
									<li>Muxing the audio and subtitles with finished video</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
					</div>
								
					<div class='col-sm-3'>
						<p class='listsct-hdr'>Audio included will be in the following languages:</p>
							<div class='list-sct'>
								<ul class='list'>
									<li>English</li><br>
									<li>French</li><br>
									<li>Portuguese</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
					</div>
							
					<div class='col-sm-3'>
						<p class='listsct-hdr'>Subtitles (crossing our fingers) will be available in the following languages:</p>
							<div class='list-sct'>
								<ul class='list'>
									<li>English</li><br>
									<li>French</li><br>
									<li>Portuguese</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class='sct2-endtxt'>
				<p>All of this will be done on the original episodes, from episode 1 to episode 95 and the two prequel episodes, and possibly a select few other videos (TBD by the team).</p>

				<p style='font-style:italic'>No work or edits will be performed on any other CL or CL-based works, specifically Evolution.</p>
			</div>
			
<!----SECTION 3-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
			<h3 class='sct3-hdr'>Get Involved</h3>
			<p class='sct3-desc'>We need help, and a lot of it.<br><br>

			More than anything, we could use multilingual speakers to help us out on the languages we don’t natively speak. Aside from what is already listed, we are also prospecting to add a Germanic or Slavic language to the list. There are no guarantees that it will happen, but if you speak any language in those fields and are interested in helping, please do contact us via the info listed below.<br><br>

			If you happen to have any background knowledge in the art of digital video, and feel that you would like to contribute here, you can also contact us for this. In this particular field, you would likely be placed as a rendering tester, as we are trying to figure out the best possible model for configuring and rendering each season. If you have good experience in video editing/upscaling, and feel you can impart knowledge/information that might advance this project, this would also be a welcome contribution to the team.<br><br>

			If you wish to help us create test renders and/or help render all of the final videos, we would love to have you, but we must also require that you have a decent graphics card (Alex wants GTX 1080’s and up).</p>

<!----SECTION 5-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
			<h3 class='sct5-hdr'>Where You Can Find This</h3>
			<div class='sct5-desc'>
				<p>For the time being, we have a YouTube channel where we’ll be putting anything worth looking at before the entirety of the project is complete.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Update:</strong> New Youtube channel Converted from Alex’s Backup channel allowing us a greater audience.
				<br><br>
				Once the whole project is done, however, we don’t know what the best way to make this accessible to everyone will be, but the surefire way is through that YouTube channel.</p>
