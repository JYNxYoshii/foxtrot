				<h3 class='sct-head'>Who Are We?</h3>
				<p class='sct1-bdy'>
				We are a small team of about three to four consistent members, and we’re committed to preserving Code Lyoko in the best quality possible. With the usage of  kick-ass deep-learning algorithms and cold hard sweat, we will bring you the finest premium USDA-approved viewing experience for Code Lyoko you’ve ever laid eyes on. With all the fixings—subtitles, multiple audio tracks, and bonus features, we can find or make, just like a shiny new DVD or Blu-ray Disc.<br><br>

				Jokes aside, this project was originally created by Christian77777 in late March of 2017  to improve his home server collection of Code Lyoko. This, however, started to turn into a group effort when he asked for help from Alex who had access to higher-end hardware that would quicken the process of improving the video quality. Christian realized other fans of the show would probably enjoy his efforts, so he made a call for help to the Code Lyoko subreddit to provide him with media required to create a meaningful remaster of the show. A humble but determined group of subtitlers and programmers formed, and we decided to name ourselves the Foxtrot Fanatics.

						Our project is actually a subset of two projects working together simultaneously.
						</h4>
							
						<div class='col-left'>
							<h4>
							Transcription Project
							</h4>
							<ul>
							<li>-Transcribing the show (Mostly manually. YouTube’s automatic captions can be dumb.)</li>
							<li>-Turning the transcripts into timed subtitles</li>
							<ul>
						</div>
						
						<div class='col-right'>
							<h4>
							Upscale Project
							</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>-Locating the best original video source of the show</li>
								<li>-Creating a custom automated program: FoxTrotUpscaler™ (trademark pending)</li>
								<li>-Facilitating the upscaling via FTU from PAL 576i 25fps to 1440p 25fps (4:3 aspect ratio)</li>
								<li>-Muxing the audio and subtitles with finished video</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<div class='av-expec'>
						<ul>
							<li class='ave-head'>Audio included will be in the following languages:</li>
							<li>English</li>
							<li>French</li>
							<br>
							<li class='ave-head'>Planned Subtitling:</li>
							<li>English</li>
							<li>French</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class='sct3-foot'>
						<p class='s3f-cont'>
						All of this will be done on the original episodes, from episode 1 to episode 95 and the two prequel episodes, and possibly a select few other videos (TBD at the discretion of the team).<br>
						<br>
						<strong>We will not be performing any work on any other CL works (namely Evolution).</strong>

				<h3 class='sct-head'>How Can I Get Involved?</h3>
				<p class='sct4-bdy'>
				More than anything, we could use people with the time and willingness to transcribe. This is the part that takes a lot of time, but we still want to do it, because we know that fans worldwide would love to have them.<br>
				<br>
				No previous background experience is required to become a transcriber. All you need is a few hours out of the week, a keyboard, a computer that can play video, and a willingness to lend a hand. We will fill you in on everything else you need to know to get the job done once you’re in and ready.<br>
				<br>
				If you happen to have any background knowledge in the art of digital video, and feel that you would like to contribute here, you can also contact us for this.<br>
				<br>
				And of course, if there is something else that wasn’t listed here but you think you might want to contribute, do feel free to contact us about that as well.
